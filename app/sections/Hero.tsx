              From Now On has been a long time coming and is easily the most
              honest collection of songs we have made so far as a group.
              It&apos;s heavier, darker and decidedly more Beauty School than
              ever before. We&apos;ve lived lot since Happiness and we are so
              excited for you to hear this record in full on â€œx October 2025.
              From us to you, &quot;From Now On&quot;.
